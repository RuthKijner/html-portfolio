<h1>The Best Movies To Watch(According to Ruth)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Matrix (1999)</h3>
<p>A film that was ahead of its time in terms of 
   its amazing effects, while carefully maintaining a suspenseful 
   and interesting plot that draws you completely into the world of
   Neo. All the high-level actors were carefully chosen, the script
   is smart and after. For me, the first film in the series is the most 
   successful and always leaves a taste for more</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings </h3>
<p>One of the things that grabs your attention is the shots of breathtaking
    landscapes in the most beautiful places in the world! When you combine a
    fascinating story with actors who know how to convey the text at the highest
    level, this is what makes it possible to watch a 3-hour movie and get bored as
    soon as it's over.</p>
<h3>What Women Want</h3>
<p>The film is about a womanizing man who did not take women and vices very seriously.
   He was cursed with a curse that was also the best gift he could receive in his life
   began to hear the thoughts of all the women in his life and was terrified to discover
   everything they thought of him and how they really saw him. But when he began to understand
   the complexity of women, he learned to love their complexity. Here begins the turning point
   that makes him a better person, a better father and a better partner. A light-hearted film,
   elements of romantic comedy. Perfect for a Friday night movie.</p>
